Description: A minimal jamovi library specifically designed to make the estimation of Machine Learning
    (ML) techniques as easy and accessible as possible, particularly within the framework of
    the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) process in data mining. The package provides
    essential tools to structure and execute each stage of a predictive or classification
    modeling workflow, aligning closely with the fundamental steps of the KDD methodology,
    from data selection and preparation, through model building and tuning, to the
    interpretation and evaluation of results using Sensitivity Analysis. The 'MLwrapj' workflow
    is organized into four core steps; preprocessing(), build_model(), fine_tuning(), and
    sensitivity_analysis(). These steps correspond, respectively, to data preparation and
    transformation, model construction, hyperparameter optimization, and sensitivity analysis.
    The user can access comprehensive model evaluation results including fit assessment metrics,
    plots, predictions, and performance diagnostics for ML models implemented through 'Neural
    Networks', 'Random Forest', 'XGBoost' (Extreme Gradient Boosting), and 'Support Vector
    Machines' (SVM) algorithms. By streamlining these phases, 'MLwrapj' aims to simplify the
    implementation of ML techniques, allowing analysts and data scientists to focus on
    extracting actionable insights and meaningful patterns from large datasets, in line with
    the objectives of the KDD process.
